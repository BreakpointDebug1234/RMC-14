  ## What do Military Police do?


  Military police are the role that is entrusted in-game to enforce Mlaw (Marine law) and S.O.P. (Standard Operating Procedure). This is typically done with the intent of enforcing server rules and roleplay standards in a way that can be immersive in character. The goal of being a MP is not to brig as many marines as you can. That is frowned upon. The goal of MPs is to make the server a more immersive and enjoyable place for everyone. Do your best to uphold that goal.

  ## Security Alert Levels
  The ship has multiple alert levels, which can be changed in the C.I.C. They are as follows.


  <Box>
    [color=green][bold] GREEN ALERT [/bold]
  </Box>


  <Box>Green Alert is the normal operating state of the ship. Standard S.O.P applies, and non combatants have strict weapon restrictions. At this Alert level, you should focus on patrolling and just doing general security of the ship. There are no known threats that need to be immediately addressed</Box>


  <Box>
    [color=blue][bold] BLUE ALERT [/bold]
  </Box>


  <Box>Blue alert is an elevated security level that implies a potential or unknown threat to the ship. This might include a death with no known cause, or the possibility of a mutiny. Weapon restrictions are slightly loosened on blue as outlined in S.O.P. Blue alert also authorizes the use of riot equipment and longarms for the Military Police</Box>


  <Box>
    [color=red][bold] RED ALERT [/bold]
  </Box>


  <Box>Red alert is a very elevated security level that is intended to convey a serious and known threat to the ship. This includes any hostile boarding, active shooters, and more. Weapon restrictions on red alert are much looser as outlined in S.O.P. This also automatically opens all of the armories on the ship so that the crew may defend themselves with lethal force.</Box>


  ## M.P Equipment
  Military police have a large assortment of specialized equipment provided to perform their duties. They are listed below, color coded to their alert restrictions for M.Ps.


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RMCHandcuffs"/>
  </Box>
  Handcuffs are a core tool for MPs which allow you to retrain somebody by clicking on them with the cuffs in your hand. The do-after is canceled if they move, so make sure to stun non compliant marines first. While they are handcuffed, they cannot move when you are holding on to them.


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RMCZipties"/>
  </Box>
  Zip-Ties work identically to handcuffs, except when you remove them from somebody, they break and become unusable. This is useful if you do not want to worry about leaving handcuffs laying around. One time use, so zip and forget!


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CMStunbaton"/>
  </Box>
  The Stun baton is a short range Melee stun implement which will stun a marine with a single hit. It must be activated (with Z) to stun someone. You can tell when its on by inspecting it, or looking for the sprite to be lit up. Can be charged by inserting it into a recharger.


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RMCWeaponTaser"/>
  </Box>
  The Disabler is a Sidearm style stun tool that fires electric bolts. With consecutive hits it will stun a target from range and allow you to close the distance. Be aware the stun is slightly shorter than the baton, so you may need to stun them again once you reach them depending on the distance. Can be charged at a recharger.


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CMFlash"/>
  </Box>
  The Flash Is a handheld device which can be used in two ways.
  - With harm mode active, you can click directly on somebody with it to flash them directly. This will apply a stun and knock them down
  - You can also click Z while holding it to produce a small radius flash that will disorient and slow down, but not stun. Cannot be recharged at a recharger, but it will slowly recharge uses over time.


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CMArmorM2MP"/>
  </Box>
  The standard Armor for the Military Police. It is adequately armored and lighter than its standard marine counterpart. It has very well rounded protection, and does decent in all categories though it is not the best in any of them.


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RMCArmorVestMP"/>
  </Box>
  A lightweight armor that MPs can elect to take from their equipment vendor. It Provides no slowdown effect and is very fast to run in, however it also provides very minimal protection and will not protect you at all against acid or biological threats in any way.


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CMArmorRiot"/>
  </Box>
  This heavy and bulky armor will take some heavy punishment from conventional threats like knives, bullets, and the like. In exchange you will  be slowed down quite a lot while wearing it. Do note that It is not helpful against acid or biological threats in any way whatsoever. (A total of 6 sets can be found in the brig armory)


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RMCGrenadeFlashBang"/>
  </Box>
  Flashbangs are a very effective tool for large areas or crowds. Once thrown they will detonate, stunning targets within a large radius for a very long time. M.Ps are also stunned by this, so make sure you either throw it around cover or move away from it once thrown. They may be carried on green alert. But only for self defense or defense of others. Do not throw them needlessly!


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RMCVendorSecArmory"/>
  </Box>
  Rubber Rounds are Less-Lethal bullets which can be fired from most standard issue weapons. After a certain number of shots on target, they will be stunned for a short duration. Be very careful to keep track of your ammo types! Useful for Prisoners of War, and other non marines who might be resistant to the disabler.


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RMCBoxShotgunBeanbag"/>
  </Box>
  Bean Bag shells are an effective riot control tool that can stun targets in a few shots. They are fired specifically out of the Riot Shotgun found in the armory. Useful for Prisoners of War, and other non marines who might be resistant to the disabler.


  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="RMCWeaponShotgunM890Riot"/>
  </Box>

  ## Arrest Procedure
  Use the following steps/checklist to help walk you through the process of arresting a suspect


  -  Witness a crime, Recieve an arrest order from an officer, or receive a warrant from the C.M.P
  -  Locate the suspect and attempt to detain them. (Use Less lethal tools when needed)
  -  Bring the suspect to the brig, and place them in the holding cell by the large desk. THEY SHOULD REMAIN CUFFED!
  -  Inform the warden of what happened, as well as any other information they request. The warden may also ask you to do some paperwork.


  ## Brigging Procedure
  The following checklist is for the Military Warden once a suspect has been detained and brought in.


  -  Gather any information you need to sentence them from the arresting M.P
  -  Refer to Marine law and note the applicable charges.
  -  Inform the suspect of their charges as well as their total sentence.
  -  Strip them of all gear and contraband. Be meticulous. Do not miss Webbing, Boots, coats, Ect.
  -  There will be a prisoner uniform and prisoner headset located in the brig lockers to give the prisoner.
  -  Offer them the opportunity to appeal their sentence. This must be handled within the first ten minutes of brigging them.
  -  Once their time expires, return their items and dismiss them from the brig.


  ## Processing Survivors/Visitors
  Some operations, you may have non-UNMC aligned individuals board the ship. This is most commonly survivors from the colony, but might also include events where members of other factions arrive into the area of operations. All of these visitors who are not from the UNMC must be searched and processed on arrival. (Note that FORECON on chances claim is a special squad from the UNMC, and do not need searched)


  - Build a connection to the visitors. Be polite and show consideration. If they trust you the process will go much smoother.
  - Explain to them all that they will need to be processed before they may explore the ship. Then offer a chance for those who do not wish to be processed to simply drop back down to the colony.
  - Take the visitors who wish to remain to a secure area, and search their belongings. Confiscate any weapons, ammunition, explosives, and the like.
  - Return the remainder of their belongings, and explain to them all items will be returned should they choose to leave at a later time.


  ## Survivor Rights
  Survivors have rights in S.O.P, and it is our job to ensure we give them said rights. These include but are not limited to


  - The right to construction tools and materials. This is not contraband.
  - The right to short blades, like knives. (See weapon restrictions in S.O.P)
  - The right to leave at any time, assuming they are not already detained.
  - The right to their confiscated belongings being secure, and not taken.
